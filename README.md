# Automated_Ubuntu_ServiceWebsite_Deployment_Locally-IAC
Deploy locally a website called Clean Work To Ubuntu, by providing Infrastructure As Code. For automating/provisioning website setup I am using Vagrant.
If you want to run the script, then
 - Confirm that you have Vagrant and a virtualization provider (e.g., VirtualBox) installed.
 - Navigate to the project directory and run ' vagrant up ' to initiate the local development environment.
After setup open the private IP address in the host machine's browser
 - Website URL: - http://192.168.56.12/#
